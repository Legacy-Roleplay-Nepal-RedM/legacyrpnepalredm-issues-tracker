## op-framework
The 'OP Framework' project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server with advanced and highly developed features, all made from scratch.

All development is done by me (@InZidiuZ#6969). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done thoroughly. I expect to regularly push updates introducing new features, bug fixes and balancing changes.

For more information, join the official [OP-FW discord guild](https://discord.gg/yRBWkjb).

## Issues
It is requested that you report any issues you may encounter with the OP Framework in the "Issues" tab in this GitHub repository.

Issues related to assets, should at this time be reported in [this](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker) GitHub repository.

## Whats the difference between "script" and "asset" issues?

### [Script Issues](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/op-framework-issue-tracker)
Script issues involve problems or suggestions related to the activities, interactions, and features within the game that require coding to function. For example, if you encounter a problem with a job or a heist in the game not working as expected, that's a script issue. It also includes adding new activities like jobs, heists, or items, as well as fixing bugs in these features. If there's an issue with the game's user interface, like a menu not displaying correctly, or if a new feature needs to be added to the game, these are also script issues. Essentially, anything that involves creating or fixing the interactive parts of the game falls under this category.

### [Asset Issues](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker)
Asset issues are related to the visual and physical elements in the game. This includes the creation or modification of maps and buildings, designing new 3D models for props, vehicles, and weapons, and adjusting how these items look and behave. For instance, if a vehicle's appearance or handling needs adjustment, or if there are problems with how a building or object looks or interacts with the environment (like broken textures or collisions), these are asset issues. Additionally, creating or updating vehicle liveries and fixing any graphical glitches also fall under this category. In short, if it’s about what you see and interact with physically in the game, it’s an asset issue. Asset issues should go [here](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker) instead of in this issue tracker.

## Rules
To make sure we're all on the same page about what this issue tracker is meant for, please read through and follow the rules below.

**§ 1.** All issues should be in English, *and only English*.<br/>
**§ 2.** Give your issue a proper title.<br/>
**§ 3.** When creating an issue, select **and follow** a template.<br/>
**§ 4.** Your issues should include as much *relevant* information as you can provide.<br/>
**§ 5.** Suggestions should be specific and structured, and not vague and undetermined.<br/>
**§ 6.** The framework is meant to be easily scalable and future proof, meaning creating issues to request a 'turf' and 'storage container' for your gang should not be done. Be more creative and propose something that *is* scalable and dynamic.<br/>
**§ 7.** Don't create an issue on a topic that already has an issue open. **Always use the search function before creating an issue!** Instead, use the already existing issue to add onto the topic.<br/>
**§ 8.** Engaging in the comment section of issues is encouraged, though please **do not** post comments without any value, i.e. "+1" comments. Use GitHub's reaction feature for such instead.<br/>
**§ 9.** Issues should be associated with the framework's continued development.<br/>
**§ 10.** Don't hijack other people's issues.<br/>
**§ 11.** Only include one topic per issue. Creating multiple issues for multiple bugs/suggestions is not disallowed nor discouraged.
